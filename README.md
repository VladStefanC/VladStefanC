# Hi there, I'm Vlad ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Software Developer with nearly 4 years of experience building full-stack applications, working closely with hardware and system layers. Iâ€™ve worked across backend, frontend, and simulation tools, creating practical and efficient solutions.

Currently expanding my skill set with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and SQL â€” excited about full-stack development and modern web technologies.

ðŸ’¡ Here are some things Iâ€™m passionate about:
- Building clean, maintainable code
- Learning new frameworks and tools
- Collaborating in teams and solving challenging problems

ðŸ”­ Check out some of my projects below, including [ReactChatApp](https://github.com/VladStefanC/ReactChatApp) â€” a real-time chat application built with React.
